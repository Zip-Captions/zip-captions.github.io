James is a full-stack software developer with a decade of cloud development experience. As a former teacher, he's passionate about using technology to empower learners to seek, find and use information to improve learning. He is an advocate for free and open technology, and believes that community-building is the true power of the internet.

When he's not working on ZipCaptions, he spends his free time tinkering with hobby electronics in the smart home area of interest, usually involving 3D printing and lots of blinking lights. He also enjoy spending time outdoors, taking his dog for a walk among the fields of rural Quebec, paddling his canoe in one of Canada's many beautiful lakes and rivers, or working on some home improvement project, indoors or out.
