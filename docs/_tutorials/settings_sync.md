Zip Captions can sync your settings against your stored settings on our cloud server. This allows you to store your preferred settings across multiple devices, or to restore your settings after a temporary change.

To get started:

1. Click on Login on the homepage.

5. Any changes to your settings will now give you this tile, where you can choose to toggle between the local settings, and server settings. Choosing to save current will overwrite your saved settings with your current local ones, or choosing to Apply Saved will overwrite your local settings with the cloud based ones.
