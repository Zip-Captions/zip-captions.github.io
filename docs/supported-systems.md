Zip Captions relies on the microphone on your device and the Speech Recognition API (a special set of instructions which allows your browser to do more than just browse the web). In order for Zip Captions to work correctly, you will need to ensure that you have:
- A working microphone on your device
  * This could be an inbuilt microphone, or an external device such as Bluetooth, USB or even a USB soundcard.
- A supported browser (see the list below)
- A screen to display the captioning
- A working internet connection depending on your browser

Zip Captions supports the following web-browsers:
- Chrome (version 33 and above)
- Safari (version 14.1 and above)*
- Edge (version 79 and above)
- Opera (version 29 and above)*
- Chrome for Android (version 33 and above)
- Safari for iOS (version 14.5 and above)*
- Samsung Internet (version 2.0 and above)
- WebView for Android (version 4.4.3 and above)

*Some features might be unavailable in this browser

Browsers which do not currently support the Speech Recgonition API:
- Firefox
- Firefox for Android
- Chromium
If you're using one of these browsers, we suggest you reach out to their developers to encourage them to support Speech Recongition.
